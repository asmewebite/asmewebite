                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                   
                    <div class="row gy-4">
                         <div class="col-lg-8">
                              <p>The most commonly asked question is Why can’t we just use fuel-efficient and cheap car
                                engines in our airplanes? The answer is that the best automobile engine in the world is
                                somewhat still poor for aircraft engines because car engines are designed to provide quick
                                bursts of relatively high power output for acceleration, and then only modest power output
                                for steady-state cruising. It’s unusual for an auto engine to operate anywhere near its
                                redline rpm or max-rated power output. Airplanes, on the other hand, usually take off and
                                climb near 100 percent power output, followed by steady-state cruise often at 75 percent
                                power. Aircraft engines are designed to sustain this punishment reliably over a typical
                                2,000-hour service life.
                                
                              </p>
                              <p>You can build your own airplane by buying a kit and choosing whichever engine you like to
                                fl
                                for the plane. Generally a certified aircraft engine will cost on average $15,000 - $30,000.
                                And this is just for the 150HP engines and below. If you want power output in the 180 HP
                                plus region, then you’re going to shell our more dollars. This is where auto conversion
                                engines come in.

                      why use a car engine to fly airplanes? well for one, it’s less expensive to buy and to
                      maintain. This is because car engines like Honda are already mass produced and
                      parts/labor are available everywhere.

                    <h4>PROCESS:</h4>


                    <div class="row gy-4">
                      
                      <div>
                        <p>
                          Let us go a little bit into the process of taking a car engine and then you convert it into an
                          airplane engine. Basically the process starts by using used engines that doesn't mean
                          junkyard engines, it’s basically the latest year of the model engines like 2018 Honda
                          Accord; 2018 Mitsubishi engines those are the engines that are buyed with two to ten
                          thousand miles thinks that where the insurance companies decided that the engine is not
                          or car is not rebuildable but the engine compartment was never really touched in an
                          accident, obviously these cars have been in some kind of an accident where they were hit
                          on the side or in the back or even a lot of engine we get shipping damage when the cars
                          came in from different countries and things like that so that’s how the process starts it
                          uses a technology that basically if you had to go and buy it not bolt by bolt would cost
                          tremendous amount of money because we can start out with a really nice engine that comes in here with the different salvage companies and the insurance company to
                          deliver them. We can start the process from an engine that’s already assembled that has
                          no damage that has been thoroughly checked out put on machine parts and wire harness
                          and ECU that operates the engine we can then take for instance the prototype approach
                          would be to pick an engine go through the drafting of the gearbox the layout of a wire
                          harness table put the engine on the dyno and get the proper Pro protocol in the ECU
                          that’s gonna operate the engine for instance with the turbo engines and the 130 it’s very
                          sophisticated process because those are direct injected, its a port injected so that the
                          process is more traditional and an easier to do. So, that’s the basic steps that happen.

              <div class="col-lg-8" style="text-align: justify;">
                <p>
                  Engines that are made in mass produced, you can buy parts everywhere, anywhere and
                  for a reasonable price so back to Viking an engine called a Viking 110 and it was a 1.5
                  litre Honda and it was really designed to be lighter than in the car machined, pretty
                  much every part of that engine other than the crankshaft and the block, some chain
                  housing cover plate with engine mounts for aircraft use and so forth and ended up being
                  a good engine was out.
                </p>

                <P>It was made and used for many years and then decided that it lost sight of the idea of
                  keeping as much of the car engine as possible. So, now went on another search for the
                  lightest of engines rather than taking one and making it lighter, so just picked an engine
                  that was smaller which is the Mitsubishi 90 horse and left honda fit engine upright the
                  way it is in the car, in fact all engines from 1:10 was the only horizontal engine(it was a
                  upright engine) that was made to lay horizontal, then decided to make a new gearbox
                  with the 3rd gear and idler gear and because we now can raise the thrust line there was
                  no need to lay the engine on its side which was a game changer for our business because
                  now the engine could be produce quickly reliably and they could be just like they sit and
                  operate in the car meaning that when someone wants an engine its instantly done means
                  that can be shipped out and just simplify the process and made that whole thing easier
                  and currently at Viking the current production line is like I mentioned 90 horse derived
                  from a Mitsubishi car the 130 horsepower which is a Honda fit and the 150-380
                  horsepower which is all the same engine but we can take out of different horsepower
                  depending on the amount of boost that were those engines are producing because that
                  particular engine is turbocharged engine.

                <p>
                  The difference between the 130 horsepower fit engine which is also a 1.5 liter and
turbocharged 1.5 liter is that the 1.5 turbo is a different animal altogether. Honda
produced a turbo engine from scratch it happens to have 1.5 liter like the fit engine but
everything else is different it has sodium filled exhaust valves, the exhaust is on the
opposite side of the cylinder head, it’s a different block altogether different bringings so
forth and so on so there’s an engine that’s made and designed by Honda to be
turbocharged comes with a very nice digital wastegate for the turbocharger which we've
programmed through our ECU so the basic engine can take care of itself even at attitude
you want to maintain 4 inches or 4 pounds of boost the engine will do that automatically
by itself and pretty sophisticated nice engine.

     <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">One question that comes to our mind is: Why couldn’t our car engine run at, say, 2,700 rpm
      all the time, about the same as that of many piston aircraft engines producing full power?
      Reciprocating aircraft engines generally spin a propeller via direct drive, with the prop
      essentially bolted to the crankshaft. Typically, piston aircraft engines produce peak power
      output at a redline near 2,700 rpm. But compared with car engines, aircraft engines
      produce gobs of torque at relatively low rpm. Auto engines, on the other hand, usually
      produce very little torque at those settings, while also relying on liquid cooling. They’re
      generally designed to produce their peak power at settings above 6,000 rpm, and so to
      work they need a reduction gear box. Still, that hasn't stopped some manufacturers from
      adapting automotive engines for aviation duty, and often with impressive results. Austro
      Engine did it with its super-efficient AE300 turbo diesel based on a Mercedes-Benz
      engine. Viking Aircraft Engines of Edgewater, Florida, meanwhile, has adapted the engine
      from the tiny Honda Fit for use in LSAs. Its liquid-cooled gasoline engine (pictured)
      produces 110 hp at 5,800 rpm and burns just 3.5 gph at its economy cruise setting.</p>
