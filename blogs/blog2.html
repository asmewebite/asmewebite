                    <p>Humans are one of the most curious creatures who will go beyond lengths to conquer the world and expand their horizons. We have this nature instilled within us, right from era of Homo Sapiens to Vikings. To learn more about universe and its celestial bodies we sent spacecraft, probes, orbiters, humans and even animals to various space missions. As time progressed, we gradually discovered that sending mobile robots aka Rovers is more practical than sending liable spacepersons on these highly prime and costly missions. Rovers are Robotic devices to explore extra-terrestrial areas which may be semi or fully automated and equipped with camera, antennas, Lasers, robotic arms, spectrometer etc. These instruments help in collection of samples such as dust, soil, rocks, and even liquids which are essential in space exploration. With other countries like China, UAE on their way to launch future missions to space, the use of rovers will only increase to test and experiment the surface of these celestial bodies. From Lunokhod rover to moon by USSR in 70s, to Perseverance to Mars by NASA, there are great examples of how humans are always able to find their way to progress and learn from their previous to march ahead towards the unknown territory. </p>

                    <p>Here are compact details of their instruments and current status of rovers sent to Moon and Mars: – </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: 700;">Lunar Rovers </p>

                    <p>These missions were early attempts of various nations to learn about the lunar surface and to win the Space Race which were predominant in era of (1960-1980). These rovers were examples of how with limited technology and resources, humans still prevailed and achieved these successes. Here are some rovers which were sent to our own satellite Moon </p>

It was launched on November 10, 1970 and landed on 17th of same month. It was equipped with antennas, laser devices, x-ray spectrometer and telescope, cosmic ray detector. It has other devices too to test soil samples of lunar body. It was powered by batteries which were charged by solar cell which were recharged during day. Travelling a distance of 10.5 km, it remained operational for next 11 months till October 4 1971, where it returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. In addition, it performed 25 lunar soil analyses. </li>

The First Mars Pathfinder mission was launched on December 6, 1996 that landed on July 4, 1997. It was designed for 8 sols but its mission extended up to 83 sols. Sojourner has solar panels and a non-rechargeable lithium-thionyl chloride battery of 150-watt hours. It had a 64Kb Ram CPU. It communicated with radio modem to send data to the base stations. The Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer determined the elemental composition of Mars rocks and dust, except for hydrogen. It had three cameras, comprising of 484 pixels. The rover needed the base station to communicate with Earth, despite continuously functioning even after the time communications ended. It travelled a distance of just over 100 meters by the time its communication was lost. It’s one of the popular rovers and has also been featured in Star Trek and The Martian. </li>

It had lots of other features like, Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, Chemistry and Mineralogy, Sample Analysis at Mars, Dust Removal Tool, Radiation assessment detector, Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons and Robotic arm which makes it one of the most advanced Rover ever. The drill samples taken in 2015 uncovered organic molecules of benzene and propane in 3-billion-year-old rock samples in Gale Crater. Its 2-year mission year extended indefinitely after December 2012 and is still operational to this date.</p>
                         <p>Perseverance is part of Mars 2020 mission by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory that is planned to launched on 30th July and to land in February 2021 at Jezero crater. The design of Perseverance is nearly similar to Curiosity but this time it was more thick and robust structure to sustain damage on the Martian surface. Rover’s generator (MMRTG) which have plutonium dioxide as the source of steady supply of heat that is converted to electricity. (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials, (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar to image different ground densities, structural layers, buried rocks, meteorites, and detect underground water ice, Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA)- a set of sensors that measure temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, radiation, and dust particle size and shape, Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE) produce a small amount of oxygen from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide, (SHERLOC), an ultraviolet Raman spectrometer that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds with 23 cams like Mastcam-Z with zoom option and SuperCam provide imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy in rocks and regolith from a distance.  </p>

                             <p>Mars Helicopter Ingenuity is the latest addition this time. It’s a solar-powered helicopter drone that finds the best driving route for the rover. It has to fly up to five times for no more than 3 minutes per day for 30 days testing. The samples of soil and results collected from the Mars are planned to return the Earth in future Missions.
                           </p>
                         <p>As the 30th of JuIy approaches, I am keenly waiting for this rover’s launching and its landing in February. I was astonished about these rovers which have been sent at a time period as early as the 70s. The latest addition of Ingenuity has been a really appreciative decision to watch the first Flying mission ever to be operated on a planet different from ours. this also highlights  the working of such bright minds of the world.</p></div>
                         </div>
                         <p> One of the most important aspects of a space mission is the landing of the lander on the extra-terrestrial surface where most of these endeavors fail. I remember how last year Pragyan (part of ISRO Chandrayaan 2 mission) rover was lost and was deemed to be a failure for our scientists. But now, NASA’s Perseverance shows that humans are explorers no pandemic would be able to stop them from achieving the impossible. I have the highest admiration for these brilliant science warriors working since the last 6 years to make such missions, successful. The way NASA continually strives to work and explore new territories with new missions of Dragonfly to launch in 2026 to Titan, just fuels up the fire within many such budding scientists and astronauts who wish to change the world and make it a better place. </p>
                         <p>Ending my article by Carl Sagan’s words, “every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring–not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive… If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.” and very rightly so! </p>
